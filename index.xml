      <description>MetaCTF 2020 - Password Here Please For this CTF, I&#39;ll upload the challenges I found interesting as individual write-ups. I don&#39;t know how many I&#39;ll do (time is a bastard) but I&#39;ll try and get at least a few. For this challenge specifically, I have the source code down below, as well as my full script in the tl;dr.
Description I forgot my bank account password! Luckily for me, I wrote a program that checks if my password is correct just in case I forgot which password I used, so this way I don&#39;t lock myself out of my account.</description>

      <description>Army Cyber Institute Capture the Flag On the ball this year about starting right away, so let&#39;s get right in
Skip the Tutorial - 0 no thanks
First Rule - 1 So this one is just getting us familiar with what a flag looks like; in this case, ACI{this_is_a_flag}
Distant Socializing - 2 This one&#39;s easy, just join an appropriate group (NCO, in my case), and you get a flag: ACI{welcome_to_the_club}</description>

      <description>Got the idea for this one from a conversation I had with one of our senior network engineers at work. I had been using ping -t &amp;lt;ip&amp;gt; for seeing when someone rebooted devices and they came back online. That works fine for one device, but I ended up needing multiple, so I input a couple commands in powershell:
$iplist = @()$iplist += &amp;lt;ip1&amp;gt;$iplist += &amp;lt;ip2&amp;gt;$iplist += &amp;lt;ip3&amp;gt;while ($true) {foreach ($ip in $iplist) {if (test-connection -computername $ip -count 1 -erroraction silentlycontinue){write-host &amp;#34;$ip is up&amp;#34;}}}which creates an array, adds the three IP addresses I wanted to test, and then alternates between test-connection on them, which is essentially a ping, but writes &amp;ldquo;&amp;lt;ip&amp;gt; is up&amp;rdquo; instead of the output of test-connection.</description>

      <description>Mongo Pilfer - CranberryPi After the last CranPi, I took a week break from the ctf to focus on work, but with the arrival of the weekend and completion of some overdue errands, I was ready to go. To get into the swing of things, I decided to start cleaning up the other CranberryPis I dutifully noted before, starting with Holly Evergreen&#39;s in the NetWars Continuous room (where I made a cameo!</description>

      <description>Today&#39;s post is covering one of the first things I made at my previous employer, which I also have a sanitized version on my github here. We used smartcards for login, and we had separate cards and accounts for administration. We also couldn&#39;t select a separate account through UAC for installers/administrative applications, so the solution was to open command prompt and run runas /smartcard cmd.exe, select the admin card, and have a command prompt open as our admin account.</description>

      <description>good (morning|afternoon|evening) I&#39;m Josh. I realized recently that I&#39;ve accumulated a lot of knowledge on scripting and capture-the-flag-ing, and decided I&#39;d consolidate that knowledge into a blog. I&#39;d been sitting on this domain for ages, and had a bit of fun building a site from scratch, but since I now have actual content to put out, I&#39;m opting for Hugo.
Hopefully the posts here can help future users in learning to leverage tools like powershell and python to make computers do work for them.</description>

      <description>Kringlecon 2: Turtle Doves! I&#39;m starting Kringlecon a day late this year, but I&#39;m hoping to be able to at least get as far as I got last year. This time, I plan on documenting my findings, and I&#39;ll be updating this as I go. My plan is for this to be one big post, almost in a journal/gamefaqs style.
Escape Ed - CranberryPi This one is easy, but I did have to google since i&#39;m unfamiliar with ed.</description>

      <title>josh&#39;s posh #1 - parsing the useraccountcontrol property</title>

      <description>This first one is the inspiration for the site. I&#39;ve been a bit obsessed with bitwise anding and parsing flags stored as bits ever since BPF in SANS SEC503. I ran into a situation recently where I wanted to check whether a smartcard was required for an account, but I didn&#39;t have access to active directory users and computers (dsa). A quick google search told me that the value for &amp;ldquo;smartcard required&amp;rdquo; is 262144, which briefly confused me, since that same search also told me basically all those checkboxes on the account screen are governed by the useraccountcontrol property.</description>
