      <description>This first one is the inspiration for the site. I&#39;ve been a bit obsessed with bitwise anding and parsing flags stored as bits ever since BPF in SANS SEC503. I ran into a situation recently where I wanted to check whether a smartcard was required for an account, but I didn&#39;t have access to active directory users and computers (dsa). A quick google search told me that the value for &amp;ldquo;smartcard required&amp;rdquo; is 262144, which briefly confused me, since that same search also told me basically all those checkboxes on the account screen are governed by the useraccountcontrol property.</description>
