      <description>Today&#39;s post is covering one of the first things I made at my previous employer, which I also have a sanitized version on my github here. We used smartcards for login, and we had separate cards and accounts for administration. We also couldn&#39;t select a separate account through UAC for installers/administrative applications, so the solution was to open command prompt and run runas /smartcard cmd.exe, select the admin card, and have a command prompt open as our admin account.</description>

      <title>josh&#39;s posh #1 - parsing the useraccountcontrol property</title>

      <description>This first one is the inspiration for the site. I&#39;ve been a bit obsessed with bitwise anding and parsing flags stored as bits ever since BPF in SANS SEC503. I ran into a situation recently where I wanted to check whether a smartcard was required for an account, but I didn&#39;t have access to active directory users and computers (dsa). A quick google search told me that the value for &amp;ldquo;smartcard required&amp;rdquo; is 262144, which briefly confused me, since that same search also told me basically all those checkboxes on the account screen are governed by the useraccountcontrol property.</description>
