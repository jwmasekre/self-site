      <description>Today&#39;s post is covering one of the first things I made at my previous employer, which I also have a sanitized version on my github here. We used smartcards for login, and we had separate cards and accounts for administration. We also couldn&#39;t select a separate account through UAC for installers/administrative applications, so the solution was to open command prompt and run runas /smartcard cmd.exe, select the admin card, and have a command prompt open as our admin account.</description>
